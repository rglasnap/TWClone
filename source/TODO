Possible future enhancements, which the original game lacked.


- create the ships listed in the stardock library so that people can
  find them

- upgrade cidadel above level 6. 
	* Allow planet cloaking.
	* Allow funds transfer between cidadels
	* transport colonists between planets.

- have a built in "best trade" system in computer which will show you
  paired ports from the places you have already visited 

- Give users the ability to write a "module" to add in other aliens,
  ships, etc without having to hack code. Possibly a perl or python
  type interface, or maybe simple XML definitions.
