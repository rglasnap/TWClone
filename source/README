Readme for TWClone
Website: http://twclone.sourceforge.net

Instructions on installation can be found in the INSTALL file.

Files to note:

1) PROTOCOL
	This file lists the various commands to and from the server.
	Good thing to read for those who are interested in helping,
	or making their own clients. Don't forget about UPDATE
	It's what allows for real time messages and movement.
2) INSTALL
	How to install.
3) LICENSE
	The GNU Public License

Note on data files:
	If you want to edit the data files by hand look at the header(.h) files.
	They should explain in what order the data is stored. Also if your editor
	of choice has a REPLACE option for editing files, use it lest BadThings(tm)
	happen.

Quick Install
=============
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

Developers
==========
Run "./gen" to generate Makefile.in, configure, and other files.  Note
that if you run "make" and Makefile.am or configure.in have been
changed, autoconf and automake will be automatically run, so there is
really no need to do this.

Run "./cvs2cl" to generate the ChangeLog file off of the CVS log
messages.  Something that bears noting: when checking in the ChangeLog,
please do not use a message.  Otherwise, the ChangeLog will turn into
some recursive nightmare filled with messages about itself.
