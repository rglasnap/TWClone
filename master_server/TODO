- Create a "master server" which all launched servers will report
  themselves to. (Similar to Quake) Modify the server to allow the
  user to define the master server to report to. Have a default value
  for the master server. The server would update the master server on
  start up and every 24 hours. The Master would then be able to
  produce a report similar to the one below from the original game as
  an HTML page for each reported server.

- Need to make the server track changes from each report sent by the
  server, such that only the most current informaiton is tracked.

- Need to add the ability for the server to load information from the
  XML data files on startup.

- Need to make sure that servers who which have not reported a status
  after X amount of time are removed from the listing.
